# little-possibility-spaces

A collection of microbenchmarked ways of describing possibility spaces. I'd
like to document, for a couple of systems, the _clearest and simplest_ ways
to describe a possibility space, though I'm also interested in
_computationally efficient_ solutions as well as a secondary goal.
